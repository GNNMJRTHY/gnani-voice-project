## How to setup the API
- In your client grpc code, you are required to pass headers along with the audio chunks. The headers must contain token,accesskey sent to your email id, the language that you want to use, audioformat and encoding type as key value pairs. For example, the format to be followed is below : 
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Key</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">token</td>
<td markdown="span">eyJhbGcIIUz.iOiJIUzI1NiIs-5cC.N2N2OWxBRUsxT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">lang</td>
<td markdown="span">en-IN</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
<td markdown="span">accesskey</td>
<td markdown="span">7f550a9f4c44173a37664d938f1</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
<td markdown="span">audioformat</td>
<td markdown="span">wav (amr-wb for amr-wb type)</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
<td markdown="span">encoding</td>
<td markdown="span">pcm16 (amr-wb for amr-wb type)</td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- You are required to add certficate (cert.pem) that was sent to the registered email id as part of your code.

### Note 
- Your request will not be authenticated if you fail to add any of these headers to your request.
- Each registered user can only send 250 grpc requests of 15 seconds audio each, beyond which the user will be blocked. Also, user is allowed to send only 5 concurrent requests per second. If you wish to opt for extension , please send a mail to operations@gnani.ai
- We currently support streaming through GRPC and audio with the following properties:
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
 <tbody>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">Audio Format</td>
<td markdown="span">wav (amr-wb for amr-wb type)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">Encoding Format</td>
<td markdown="span">pcm16 (amr-wb for amr-wb type)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
