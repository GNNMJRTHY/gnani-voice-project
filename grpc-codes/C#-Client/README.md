### Windows 8/8.1/10

Here's the abbreviated guide, highlighting the major steps:

1. Check the [system requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/system-requirements). These requirements help you know whether your computer supports Visual Studio 2019.

2. Apply the latest Windows updates. These updates ensure that your computer has both the latest security updates and the required system components for Visual Studio.

3. Reboot. The reboot ensures that any pending installs or updates don't hinder the Visual Studio install.

5. Download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
